**Makers Challenge for Automating Checking module - May 2025**

TodoMVC automation challenge code.

Originally completed as part of a paired challenge, but I have created a new repo to continue working on this challenge independently.

I will be continuing to build automated tests to cover the rest of the functionality as a personal development project. 

Next steps:

Adding in methods for finding items by list, boundary and edge cases and filtering functionality.
